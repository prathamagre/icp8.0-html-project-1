   <b>Mona Lisa, oil painting,</b> on a popular wood panel<i><u><b>by Leonardo da Vinci</b></u></i>probably the world’s most famous painting. It was painted 
    sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitter’s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination <hr/><br/>

   <b>The Starry Night </b>(Dutch: De sterrennacht) is an oil-on-canvas painting <i><u><b>by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.</b></u></i> Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,[4] The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.[5][6]<hr/><br/>

  <b> Napoleon Crossing the Alps</b> (also known as Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass or Bonaparte Crossing the Alps; listed as Le Premier Consul franchissant les Alpes au col du Grand Saint-Bernard) is a series of five oil on canvas equestrian portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte painted <i><u><b>by the French artist Jacques-Louis David between 1801 and 1805</b></u></i>. Initially commissioned by the King of Spain, the composition shows a strongly idealized view of the real crossing that Napoleon and his army made along the Alps through the Great St Bernard Pass in May 1800.<hr/><br/>

<b>Ancient of Days</b> is a design<i><u><b>by William Blake</b></u></i>, originally published as the frontispiece to the 1794 work Europe a Prophecy. It draws its name from one of God's titles in the Book of Daniel and shows Urizen[1] crouching in a circular design with a cloud-like background. His outstretched hand holds a compass over the darker void below. Related imagery appears in Blake's Newton, completed the next year. As noted in Alexander Gilchrist's 1863 book, Life of William Blake, the design of The Ancient of Days was "a singular favourite with Blake and as one it was always a happiness to him to copy".[2] As such there are many versions of the work extant, including one completed for Frederick Tatham only weeks before Blake's death.<hr/><br/>
