        <img src="images/leonardo.png" height="400px" alt="leonardo-da-vinci">
        <p><b><i>The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo is identified with genius,<br> not only for masterpieces such as
                    the Mona Lisa (the title for which <br>has entered the language as a superlative), The Last Supper
                    and The<br> Lady with an Ermine, but also for his drawings of technologies<br> (aircraft, tanks,
                    automobile) that were five hundred years in the future.</i></b></p>

        <img src="images/rembrandt.png" height="400px" alt="rembrandt" <br>
        <p><b><i>One the greatest artists in history, this Dutch Master is responsible for <br>masterworks such as The
                    Night Watch and Doctor Nicolaes Tulp's <br>Demonstration of the Anatomy of the Arm. But he is
                    particularly know<br> for portraits in which he demonstrated an uncanny ability to evoke the<br>
                    innermost thoughts of his subjects including himself through the play <br>of facial expression and
                    the fall of light across the sitter's features.</i></b></p>

        <h2>3.VERMEER</h2>
        <img src="images/vermeer.png" height="400px" alt="vermeer">
        <p><b><i>Remarkably, Vermeer was largely forgotten for two centuries before his<br> rediscovery in the 19th
                    century. Since then, he’s been recognized as one<br> of art history’s most important figures, an
                    artist capable of rendering works<br> of uncanny beauty. Many have argued the Vermeer used a camera
                    <br>obscura—an early form of projector—and certainly the soft blur he employs <br>appears to
                    foreshadow photorealism. But the most important aspect of his <br>work is how it represents light as
                    a tangible substance.</i></b></p>

        <p><b><i>Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) was one of towering figures of 19th-century art.<br> A leading figure of
                    Romanticism—which privileged emotions over rationalism—<br>Delacroix’s expressive paint handling and
                    use of color laid the foundation for <br>successive avant-garde movements of the 1800s and
                    beyond.Eugene Delacroix,<br> Self-Portrait with Green Vest, ca. 1837</i></b></p>

        <img src="images/jeon_antonie_watteu.png" height="400px" alt="jeon antonie watteu">
        <p><i><b>Watteau (1684–1721) was arguably the greatest French painter of the 18th-century, a transitional<br>
                    figure between Baroque art and the Roccoco style that followed. He emphasized color and movement,
                    <br>structuring his compositions so that they almost resembled theater scenes, but it was the
                    atmospheric<br> quality of his work that would become highly influential for artists like J.M.W
                    Turner and the Impressionists.<br>Jean-Antoine Watteau, The Shop Sign of Gersaint, (1720–21)</b></i>
