The juxtaposition of the two artists works may be seen as a mediation of our relationship with time as a physical<br><br>dimension of our universe and a dynamic, fluctuating process of change, that coincides with our conscious being.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Both artists keep our vulnerability from us by creating regenerative landscapes, or alchemical transformations of the existential.<br><br> They present an illusion of life so moving and complete in time and memory, that it is disconcerting, and yet we surrender ourselves <br><br>to it. The works speak of opaque depth and mystery, dimness and shadow, metaphysical enigma, and death as a mirror to life. They <br><br>suspend us between opposites, questioning our existence through persistence of time. Delving deeper into their works, one is left<br><br>with the question: does this coincidence of time and being then provide an argument against belief in a purposeful divine agent?<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
